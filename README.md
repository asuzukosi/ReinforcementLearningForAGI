## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the holy grail of artificial intelligence, aiming to create systems capable of learning and adapting to a wide range of tasks, just like humans. This project focuses on the application of reinforcement learning to achieve AGI by progressively training agents in more complex environments.

## 2. Goals and Objectives <a name="goals-and-objectives"></a>

The primary goals of this project include:

- **Exploration of RL Algorithms**: Investigating and comparing various RL algorithms, including Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and more.

- **Game Environments**: Developing and training agents in increasingly challenging game environments, from simple board games to complex 3D video games.

- **AGI Benchmarking**: Measuring and benchmarking agent performance on a standardized set of AGI tasks to evaluate progress toward AGI.

## 3. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Before diving into the project, ensure you have a basic understanding of reinforcement learning and machine learning concepts. Familiarity with Python is also essential.

## 4. Reinforcement Learning Algorithms <a name="reinforcement-learning-algorithms"></a>

Explore various RL algorithms, including:

- **Q-Learning**: A classic RL algorithm based on Q-values and value iteration.
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Leveraging deep neural networks to handle more complex tasks.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: A policy optimization algorithm for continuous and discrete action spaces.
- **Actor-Critic**: Combining actor and critic networks to improve training stability.
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: Suitable for continuous action spaces.

## 5. Experimentation <a name="experimentation"></a>

Experiment with training agents in different game environments, ranging from text-based games, simple grid worlds, to complex 3D video games. Record and analyze the performance and learning capabilities of these agents.

## 6. Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>

Challenges in achieving AGI via reinforcement learning include handling complex state spaces, ensuring efficient exploration, and generalizing learning from one task to another.

## 7. Community and Collaboration <a name="community-and-collaboration"></a>

- **Online Forums**: Engage in discussions on AI and reinforcement learning forums.
- **Conferences and Workshops**: Attend conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and workshops focused on AGI and RL.
- **Collaborative Projects**: Contribute to open-source projects and research initiatives in the field of AGI and RL.
